# Daniel's Portofolio of Cybersecurity Projects

This portfolio showcases my skills and experience in cybersecurity, particularly focused on securing cloud-based APIs and infrastructure.

## About Me

I am a passionate about cybersecurity. I have a solid background in cloud engineering. As a Cloud Engineer specializing in Apigee X and Hybrid, I've gained valuable experience in securing APIs, implementing best practices for Kubernetes security, and understanding cloud security principles. I am eager to leverage my skills to build robust security postures and pursue a career in either cloud security or offensive security.
